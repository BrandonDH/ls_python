# IDIOMATIC
# index - one word, starts with lowercase letter
# CatName - PascalCase
# π - not a very verbose label
# 1stCharacter - starts with a number

# NON-IDIOMATIC
# lazy_dog - snake_case in a function name, I'd follow a camelCase convention instead.
# quick_Fox - snake_case in a function name, I'd follow a camelCase convention instead.
# operand2 - ends with a number
# BIG_NUMBER - this is constent convention

# ILLEGAL

# Here is a corrected breakdown:

# Idiomatic: index, lazy_dog, operand2
# Non-idiomatic: CatName, quick_Fox, BIG_NUMBER, π
# Illegal: 1stCharacter
