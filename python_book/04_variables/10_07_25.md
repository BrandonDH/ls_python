# Variables continued

good constant would be `INCHES_PER_FOOT = 12` that way the unit itself is clear.

left ant right side assignment. `variable = expression` for example. 
```py
>>> left_side = 1 # assignment
>>> right_side = 2 # assignment
>>> total = left_side + right_side # assignment expression
>>> print(total)
3
```

```py
def square(number): # statement, function initialization
    return number * number # expression

forty_two_squared = square(42) # assignment
print(forty_two_squared) # result is 1764 
```

**IMPORTANT**:
left side of `=` must always be an assignment target. Expressions produce values, they are not a place to store value.

## Augmented Assignment
the performance impact to sugmented assignment is negligable, but it can be easier to read for some developers. it can ork with strings and any type that supports operators. Augmented assignment is a statement not an expression. cannot be used as a function argument or return.

from book: 
```
Rule of thumb:

If the operation computes a new value and reassigns, the type can change.
If the operation mutates the existing object in place, the type wonâ€™t change (but the contents might).
```

## Reassignment vs. Mutation

mutation is changing the value of an object assigned to a variable. reassignment is changing the binding of the variable to a value by referencing a new object.

**IMPORTANT**
```py
num = 3               # assignment (initialization)
my_list = [1, 2, 3]   # assignment (initialization)
my_dict = {           # assignment (initialization)
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
}

num = 42              # Reassignment
my_list[1] = 42       # Reassignment of element,
                      # my_list is mutated!
my_dict['b'] = 3      # Reassignment of dict pair
                      # my_dict is mutated!

# You can still reassign the variables
my_list = [2, 3, 4]   # Reassignment
my_dict = { 'x': 0 }  # Reassignment
```
