# Variables and variable names
"A variable is a label attached to a specific value stored in a program's memory."

## Naming
"There are two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors." variable names should be accurate to what they are storing. names like 'a' for labeling `13002.3` can be very misleading - something like `numberOfApplicants = 25` is much more legible.

* identifier in python refers to:
    * Variable and constant names
    * Function and method names
    * Function and method parameter names
    * Class and module names

### Some conventions
* snake_case `my_variable_name`
* don't use `__my_name` or `my_name__` double underscores have speacial meaning and should be treated as reserved conventions.
* Use standard ASCII characters
* Constants are `UPPER_CASE_NAMES`, but Python does not have a seperate to handle them, its up to the programmer.
* PascalCase or CamelCase is a convention that starts every new word with a Capital letter, and does not use underscores.

### Class names
Start with capitals `MyClass` PascalCase.

Illegal names `first,last = ['greg', 'george']`

## Create and reassign
create or initialize a variable with an assignment statement. initialize: `name = 'brandon'`, reassign `name = 'greg egg'`.
