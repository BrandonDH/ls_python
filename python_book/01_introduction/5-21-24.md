## Abstraction
- software subsystems interoperate
- interact through a UI

Python is interpreted by a program. the interpreter is written in C, and converts python to byte code and eventually a series of 0's and 1's. at a higher level programmers can use NumPy or Flask among others to interat with Pythion.

# indentation
- code must be indented properly to run. blocks need to be indented properly.
- no termination aside from `:` no `end` or `}` etc

# REPL read-eval-print loop
- type `python` into the temrinal. 
- observe `>>>`
- do not have to use print explicitly, if the expression is the last line 
`a = 24` this is assignment
- `q` to exit `help()`. `help(len)`
