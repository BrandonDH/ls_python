# input & output

## Terminal output
* `print()` can be used with all data types, but may need to be formatted. 
* seperate output with `sep` for example `sep=','`
* other ways to end the output argument `sep=','` or `end='<-\n'`
* resons to use these keword arguments is typically to adhere to operating system requirements.
* print multiple outputs by using the `;` for example `print('bob'); print('johnson')`
* can also use `print()` to start a newline

## Terminal input
* prompt for input with `get_name = input()`
* can also use `get_name = input("hey what's your name? ")` leave room at the end of the string, because there will be no space between the last character and in input.
