datatypes continued:

variables identify data, also called identifiers; which a;lso applies to constants, functions, class names and more.

initializing variables with values:
```py
pi = 3.1415926535897932
life_the_univers_and_everything = 42
```

when we create variables we are doing assignment. foo is assigned to the value 'abc' such that `foo = 'abc'`.

first a variable is initialized, then it is reassigned.

```py
foo = 'Hello, world.' #Assignment or initialization
foo = "that's all, folks" #reassignment
```

# Boolean values
binary states true or false, on or off, yes or no, one and zero..
