continuing to work on Python.

```bash
>>> f'5 plus 5 equals {5 + 5}.'
'5 plus 5 equals 10.'

>>> my_name = 'Karl'
>>> f'My name is {my_name}.'
'My name is Karl.'

>>> my_name = 'Clare'
>>> greeting = 'Ey up?'
>>> f'{greeting} My name is {my_name}.'
>>> f'{greeting} My name is {my_name}'
Ey up? My name is Clare.

```

f strings, or formatted strings, are a way of interpolating data into a string literal. similar to a template literal in JS. instead of `$` though, in Python we use an `f''` and `{}` to wrap our expression.

basic syntax:

```python
f'Blah {expression} blah.'
```

```python
foo = 'hello'
print(f'Use {{foo}} to embed a string: {foo}')
```

f-strings can have variants too.

```python 
print(f'{123456789:_}') # this will insert the '_' character between every 3 elements in the sequence.
print(f'{123456789:,}') # this will do the same as above, but it will add ',' instead of an '_'. 
```

```python
print(f'{123456.7890123:_}') # the existing decimal in this float with persist, and not the '_'.
print(f'{123456,7890123}:,') # same for this sequence within the formatted string.
```

I am personally not too sure of the implemeentation use case for this, possibly if you are outputting a report of some kind, and processing incoming data for display.

## Functions
reusable action oriented code. modularity and reuse. Functions have a data type.

## None
`None` is the abscence of value. None is a literal, and is the only literal of the NoneType class.

## Sequences
A sequence can be indexed, meaning it's objects can be treversed or trundled. they have an order an are refered to sometimes as collections.

some sequences are
- Tuples
- Lists
- Ranges

### lists and tuples
ordered lists of organized information that can contain any information.

a list uses square brackets, nd is comma-delimited

```python
['greg', {name: 'tim'}, [1,2,3,4]] # each item seperated by a comma is called an element.
```

```bash
>>> my_list = [1, 'xyz', True, [2, 3, 4]]
>>> my_list
[1, 'xyz', True, [2,3,4]]

>>> tup = ('xyz', [2, 3, 4], 1, True)
>>> tup
('xyz', [2, 3, 4], 1, True)
```

Nesting
```python
[ # Begin multi-line list literal
    "Monty Python's Flying Circus",
    ( # Begin multiline tuple literal
        'Ric Idle',
        'John Cleese',
        'Terry Gilliam',
        'Michael Palin',
        'Terry Jones',
    ), # End multi-line tuple literal
] # End multi-line list literal
```

dictionaries are another type of sequence.

```bash
>>> my_list = [1, 'xyz', True, [2, 3, 4]]
>>> my_list[0]
1

>>> my_list[1]
'xyz'

>>> my_list[2]
True

>>> my_list[3]
[2, 3, 4]

>>> my_list[4]
IndexError: list index out of range
```

```python
my_list[2] = "greg" # this is indexed reassignment, or element reassignment. This wont work an a tuple, because tuples are immutable, you cannot mutate them.
```

```bash
>>> my_list[3] 'New value'
>>> my_list
[1, 'xyz', True, 'New value']

>>> tup[3] = 'New value' # results in a type error
```

tuples are immutable which limits their common usage, but Python has a lot of ways to optimize them, and save memory and increase performance.

* The order of the elements is significant.
* Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
* Use indexing syntax to retrieve specific elements.
* Use indexing syntax to reassign specific list elements.
* Index numbers are non-negative integers starting from 0 and ending at the sequence's length minus 1. (Later, we will learn that negative  integers are also allowed. For now, though, we'll only use non-negative integers.)

### Ranges

sequence between two endpoints. commonly used to iterate over growing or shrinking sequences of integers.

`range(8)` goes from 0 to 7.
`range(2, 11)` starts at 2 and ends at 10.
`range(3, 90, 3)` start at 3, end at 89, and step by 3 elements.
