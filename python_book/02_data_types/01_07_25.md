variables and assignmnent

- here we create a variable my_name and initialized it to the value "bob".

```py
my_name = "bob"
```
this is assignment

we initialize a variable to a value. x is assigned to y is preffered lanhguage.

if the variable is being assigned for the first time it is initialization.

if the variable has been assigned before it is reassignmnet.

```
foo = 'Hello, world.'         # Assignment or initialization
foo = "That's all, folks!"    # Reassignment
```

booleans

boolean values are binary states like true or false

you can do math and comparison with booleans. see truthiness later on.

text sequences are strings. including byte strings which are byte sized values. a string is a sequence of unicode characters.

text sequence    : does not contain any objects

ordinary sequence: contains one or more objects

string literal

"bob"
'bob' often used as primary string literal syntax.
'''bob'''
"""bob"""

escape characters in a string literal with the \ backslash. "\" tells the computer the following string or character is not syntactix.

```bash
>>> my_new_car = "Toyota LandCruiser"
>>> my_new_car[3]
'o'
>>> my_new_car[-3]
's'
>>> my_new_car[-0]
'T'
>>> my_new_car[0]
'T'
>>> my_new_car[-1]
'r'
>>> -len(my_new_car)
-18
>>> my_new_car[-18]
'T'
>>> 
```

raw strings f strings

string literals with an r prefix are `raw string literals` they do not recognize escapes

```python
print(r"hi\ im not sure what the path to my house is... one\step\at\a\time?")
hi\ im not sure what the path to my house is... one\step\at\a\time?
```
raw string
f string or string interpolation.

```python

first_word = "feb"
second_word = "greg"

print(f"I would like {second_word} to visit {first_word}")

```python
>>> print(f'{1_2_3_4}')
1234
```

frunctions: 
chuck of reusable code.

absence of a value is 'None'

sequences: lists and tuples
