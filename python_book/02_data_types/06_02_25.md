# Data Types: text sequence 
strings and chracters, and byte strings.

`Hello!`

`He's pining for the fjords!`

`1969-07-20`

strings are unicode characters. 

```python
greeting = 'hello'
for letter in greeting:
    print(letter)

# h
# e
# l
# l
# o
```

text sequence, and an ordinary sequence are treated the same, like above.
ordinary sequence: 0 or more objects
text sequience: 0 objects, just contains the bytes, or characters that make up the sequence

### String literals

```python

'Hi there!'                    # single quotes
"Monty Python's Flying Circus" # double quotes

# Triple single quotes
''' King Arthur: "What is your name?"
Black Knight: "None shall pass!"
King Arthur: "What is your quest?"
Black Knight: "I have no quarrel with you, but I must cross this bridge."
'''

# Triple double quptes
"""Man: "Is this the right room for an argument?"
Other Man: "I've told you once."
Man: "No you haven't!"
"""
```

### Escape quotes

```python
print("""My nickname is "Wolfy". What's yours?""")
print('My nickname is "Wolfy". What\'s yours?')
print("My nickname is \"Wolfy\". What's yours?")
```

`\` backslash or escape character
`\\` raw-string literal can be used inslide of 

`print("C:\\Users\\Xyzzy")`

### Indexing strings

```python
>>> my_str = 'abc'
>>> my_str[0]
a

>>> my_str[1]
b

>>> my_str[2]
c

>>> my_str[4]
IndexError: string index out of range
```

negative index

```python
>>> my_str = 'abc'
>>> my_str[-1]
c

>>> my_str[-2]
b

>>> my_str[-3]
a

>>> my_str[-4]
IndexError: string index out of range
```

### raw strings and f-strings

raw string literals do not observe escape chars. they are used for regular expressions, and windows file names
r prefix before a strings means that the string is raw, can be used for regex

```python
print("C:\\Users\\Xyzzy") # Each \\ produces a literal \
print(r"C:\Users\Xyzzy") # raw string literal
```

### formatted string literals or f-strings

`f` prefix before the string. `f"bob"` used for string interpolation.

```vim
>>> f'5 plus 5 equals {5 + 5}.'
'5 plus 5 equals 10.'

>>> my_name = 'Karl'
>>> f'My name is {my_name}.'
'My name is Karl.'

```

`{my_var}` substring is interpolated with the my_var value.

`double_bracket = '{brackets}'`

`f'{{double_bracket}}'`

odd behavior here:

```vim
>>> var = '{{freg}}'
>>> print(f'{{var}}')
{var}
>>> 
```

resolved somewhat, it appears n + 1 is the formula for wrapping curly braces in formatted string literals:

```vim
>>> var = '{{{freg}}}'
>>> print(f'{{{var}}}')
{{{{freg}}}}
```
