# Basic Operations Continued

### floating point imprecision 
```python
import math
math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) # this would return true
```

* Can also use the decimal standard library `decimal.Decimal`.

```python
from decimal import Decimal
Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2') == Decimal('0.3')
```

* this will return true, bute requires string arguments.

### Equality Comparison
* == - compares operands for equalit and returns a true or false
* != - returns true if not equal
* can use built in data types for comparison

### Ordered comparison
* lexicographically, or character by character left to right when comparing strings
* standard ascii tabless can come in handy when performing comparison amongst different types of characters
* can compare sets, is a a subset or superset of b
* tuples work the same way as sets
* comparison of lists and tuples go element by element.

### String concatenation
Can use `+` and `*` with strings to join or repeat them

### Coercion
* string to integer or float `int()`, `float()` can also be called explicit coercion.
`'1' + '2'' # '12'`
`int('1') + int('2') # 3`

```python
>>> int('3') + int('3')
6
>>> int('3') + float('3')
6.0
>>> 
```
* number to string, `str()`

### Implicit Coercion
* anything that is output using the `print()` method is implicitly coerced to a string type. So doing ```python print(str(1))``` becomes redundant.

* truthiness is another element

### Determining Types
* Can use the `type()` function to get the type of the argument passed. A way to target just the name of the class for the type is `type('4').__name__`.
* `is` operator can also be used with the `type()` function.
* `isinstance()` is another function that can tell us if an object is the instance of a type or not `isinstance(1, str) # False`

### String Representations
* `repr()` vs `str()` vs `print()`
```python
>>> str(123)
'123'
>>> repr(123)
'123'
>>> print('123')
123 # could be misunderstood as being an int
```

### Collection and string length
* collection types (strings, sequences, mappings, sets) can have their elements counted.
```python
>>> len({1,4,5,3,2})
5
>>> len([123,232,11111111,])
3
>>> len({name:'bob', age:20})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'name' is not defined
>>> len({'name':'bob', 'age':20})
2
```
### Indexing and key access
* strings, ranges, lists, and tuples support indexing
```python
>>> numbers = {'bob':'robert', 'greg':'gregory'} # cannot index a dictionary without knowing it's keys.
>>> numbers[0]
>>> numbers['bob']
'robert'
```

```python
>>> "hey lets go get a snack"[7]
's'
```

```python
>>> tups = (1, '5', '[3]')
>>> tups[2]
'[3]'
>>> tups[0] = 4
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

tuples do not support bracket indexing.

### Expressions and Statements
* expression is anything that creates a value that can be used in the program.
`2 * 5`, `frank = 'frank' + 'lin'`, `int('435')`
* statement is an instruction given to python to perform an action.
`if`, `while`, `def bob():`
