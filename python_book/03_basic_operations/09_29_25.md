### expressions put values together, use functions and vsriables to create new objects
* they must be evaluated
* produces a value
```
Literals: 5, 'Karl', 3.141592, True, None
Variable references: foo or name when these variables have been previously defined.
Arithmetic operations: x + y or a * b - 5.
Comparison operations: 'x' == 'x' or 'x' < 'y'.
String operations: 'x' + 'y' or 'x' * 32.
Function calls: print('Hello') or len('Python').
Any valid combination of the above that evaluates to a single object.
```

### statement is a ninstruction to perform an action
- assignment, control flow, return, import

### differences 

* expressions always return a value, statements do not
* expressions can be part of a statement `a = b + c`

states deal with larger structures like if else and loops

### Expresion evaluation 

don't rely on precedence, use parentheses to organize expressions.

### Output vs returns
